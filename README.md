# PEPITA
Giorgia Dellaferrera's learning Algorithm

PIPITA Algorithm, the best alternative to BackPropagation.
Democratize AI through systems that consume fewer resources.

Thanks for reading, I have been thinking for a long time that Backpropagation is something unnatural and does not represent the way a real brain works, I have read the article by Giorgia Dellaferrera, where she presents her algorithm PEPITA:
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11665.pdf

If you think like us, could you help build this algorithm?

The truth is that I barely know math or programming, but I've tried, could some genius out there fix this?

I have tried to program it, and the weights of the neural networks are accommodated in such a way that the neurons of the two fowardpass give the same results, but the total error does not decrease:
